# URL Shortener
Code was developed while reading the Let's Go book by Alex Edwards.
For personal interest, I changed the scope from a `Code Snippet Hosting` to a `URL Shortener` service.

This is for personal use-case for my website: [nickfrench.dev](https://nickfrench.dev)

## Scope

- Accept any URL and output a shortened URL.
- URL redirection mapping stored in DB.
- Anyone can access redirection.
- Only admins can access create form and view page.
